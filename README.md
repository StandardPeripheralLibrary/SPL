# SPL

At the MeetingC++ 2017, Wouter van Ooijen invited people who are interessted in modern C++ in the embedded world to meet and connect. Unfortunately at the end of the discussion, the group didnâ€™t agreed on a communication channel dedicated to modern embedded C++.

During the discussion at the MeetingC++, two mayor points came up:
- Incomplete support for embedded C++ from the C++ standard (mostly due to not being able to configure STL algorithms and containers)
- The need to have a library that would give basic support for typical standard peripherals on mayor platforms.

While the first is covered by the SG14 ISO C++ working group, I would like to discuss the creation of a Standard Peripheral Library.

To do so, Wouter and Torsten would like to invite people who might be interested in the topic. Is it possible to create such a library? Where would be the boundaries of such a library? How useful could such a library be? What range of platforms could such a library support? What would the overall architect

First, we could use githubs team discussion feature to start discusing.
